## Requirements:

Display Items should be fetched from the app’s repository class and displayed to the user

While items are being fetched, a loading indicator should replace the text inside the button on screen

Display items should be displayed with red text

Clicking on Open Dialog should open an Alert Dialog

* Clicking Confirm should reverse the order of the items on screen and re-display them

* Clicking Cancel should display a Toast message to the user confirming they canceled the dialog

A Composable Preview should be created for each state the user can experience

Unit Tests should be created for applicable classes (just create the shells, no need to get passing tests)
